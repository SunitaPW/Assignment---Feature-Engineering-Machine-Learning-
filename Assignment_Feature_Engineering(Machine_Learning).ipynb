        "- - The label encoding is generally used when the categorical variable has an ordinal relationship.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**2) One-Hot Encoding :-**\n",
        "\n",
        "- - One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category. For example, for a column with the categories ('red', 'blue', 'green'), it will create three binary columns: red, blue, and green. A row containing 'red' will be represented as [1, 0, 0].\n",
        "\n",
        "- - This technique is ideal for nominal (non-ordinal) categorical variables, where no inherent ordering exists between categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - **Disadvantage :-** It can lead to high-dimensionality, especially when the categorical feature has many unique values (example, a column representing zip codes or country names), leading to sparse matrices.\n",

        "**3) Ordinal Encoding :-**\n",
        "\n",
        "- - Similar to label encoding, but it's specifically used for ordinal categorical variables (those that have a defined order or ranking, such as \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"). The categories are replaced with integers according to their order.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - This is the best method for categorical features that have a natural ranking (example, 1 for low, 2 for medium, 3 for high).\n",

        "Causation refers to a relationship between two variables where one variable directly causes the other to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words you can say, changes in one variable lead to changes in the other, typically through a cause-and-effect relationship.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Correlation :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where they change in a predictable way together. However, correlation does not imply that one variable is causing the other to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The type of correlation can be positive, negative, or no correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The cause and effect of correlation alone does not indicate that one variable is causing the other to change; it simply means that the two variables are related in some way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The correlation is important because it can help identify patterns or associations, but it cannot determine cause-and-effect relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example :- A study finds a correlation between the number of hours students spend on social media and their academic performance and the **Observation :-** The study shows that students who spend more time on social media tend to have lower grades. **Interpretation :-** There is a negative correlation between time spent on social media and academic performance. As social media usage increases, grades tend to decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Causation :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- Causation means that one variable directly influences the other, where a change in one variable directly causes a change in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The causation explicitly indicates a cause and effect relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Causation is important for understanding why something happens and making decisions based on those findings (e.g., public health policies, treatment strategies).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example :- lack of sleep directly causes a decline in cognitive function and academic performance. Researchers observe that when students are sleep-deprived, their ability to concentrate, retain information, and perform well on tests decreases."

        "- It is one of the most basic and widely used optimization algorithms. It updates the model's weights by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter and moving in the direction of the negative gradient. In stochastic version, only one random training example is used to update the parameters at each step.\n",

        "\n",

It ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's performance and helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to differences in their scales (e.g., one feature ranging from 0 to 1 and another ranging from 1 to 1,000,000).\n",

        "### sklearn.preprocessing is a module in scikit-learn used for preparing data before feeding it into machine learning models. It provides tools for scaling, normalizing, encoding categorical data, and handling missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### There are some/few common Functions in sklearn.preprocessing :-\n",
        "\n",
        "**1) Scaling and Normalization :-** These are few techniques which is used to adjust the values of numeric features in your dataset, making them more suitable for certain machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **StandardScaler :-** Standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance (i.e., Z-score normalization).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MinMaxScaler :-** Scales features to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **QuantileTransformer :-** Transforms the features to follow a uniform or normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Encoding Categorical Features :-** When working with machine learning models, many algorithms require that all input features be numeric. This module includes tools for converting categorical data into numeric representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LabelEncoder :-** Encodes target labels (class labels) as integers. Useful when you need to convert categorical labels into numerical values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OneHotEncoder :-** Converts categorical variables into a one-hot encoded (binary) format. This is useful when you need to convert nominal categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OrdinalEncoder :-** Encodes categorical features as ordinal integers (for ordinal data, where the categories have an inherent order).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) Imputation: :-** This technique is used to handle missing values in your dataset by filling them with appropriate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SimpleImputer :-** Fills missing values with mean, median, or mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4) Feature Transformation :-** Transforming features helps prepare the data for the learning process, improving performance or meeting model requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PolynomialFeatures :-** It creates polynomial features.\n",
        "\n",
